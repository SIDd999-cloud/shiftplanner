    Fairness is defined as equal distribution of assigned work relative to each
    person's voluntarily offered availability. The penalty is the statistical
    variance of conversion ratios across all eligible people.

    A penalty of zero means all persons had the same proportion of their offered
    time assigned. Only persons with offered time > 0 are included.
    Expected availability is explicitly excluded — only offered time is considered.

    Higher penalty = greater unfairness.
